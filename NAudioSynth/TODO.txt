expand buttons so there are 16 columns
remake buttons so that they are more UI friendly, little squares or circles?

look into making multiple pages that automatically generate the same button layout
//TODO ON NEW WINDOW INCREMENT/DECREMENT PAGE NO AND RESET THE BUTTONS
        //CAN'T GO ABOVE A MAX PAGE NO

make multiple tabs to be able to switch between different instruments
make the buttons scroll so that you can switch between different octaves
