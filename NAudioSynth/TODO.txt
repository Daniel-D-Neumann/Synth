remake buttons so that they are more UI friendly, little squares or circles?

Stop button so the user can stop the song when they wish
pages follow along while the music happens

REWRITE GEN FUNCTION TO HANDLE FOR MULTIPLE GENERATOR TYPES
ADD MORE GENERATOR TYPES

rewrite connection and sound to be seperate from buttons, it kinda sucks but oh well, should also make active toggleable from here
see if you can highlight from right click so the user doesn't have to keep pressing the same note to change it

EXPORT WAV
MAYBE LOOK INTO CODEC TO EXPORT MP4

Tooltips for shit?
README INSTEAD?!
