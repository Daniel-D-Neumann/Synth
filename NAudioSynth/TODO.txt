remake buttons so that they are more UI friendly, little squares or circles?


make page selector so that you can switch between different octaves

Stop button so the user can stop the song when they wish
pages follow along while the music happens


rewrite connection and sound to be seperate from buttons, it kinda sucks but oh well, should also make active toggleable from here
see if you can highlight from right click so the user doesn't have to keep pressing the same note to change it

Tooltips for shit?

On button right click open menu where note details can be changed

context menu

e.g. volume, connects to next note
